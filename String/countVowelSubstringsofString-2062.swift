 A substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.

 A vowel substring is a substring that only consists of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') and has all five vowels present in it.

 Given a string word, return the number of vowel substrings in word.

  

 Example 1:

 Input: word = "aeiouu"
 Output: 2
 Explanation: The vowel substrings of word are as follows (underlined):
 - "aeiouu"
 - "aeiouu"
 Example 2:

 Input: word = "unicornarihan"
 Output: 0
 Explanation: Not all 5 vowels are present, so there are no vowel substrings.
 Example 3:

 Input: word = "cuaieuouac"
 Output: 7
 Explanation: The vowel substrings of word are as follows (underlined):
 - "cuaieuouac"
 - "cuaieuouac"
 - "cuaieuouac"
 - "cuaieuouac"
 - "cuaieuouac"
 - "cuaieuouac"
 - "cuaieuouac"
  

 Constraints:

 1 <= word.length <= 100
 word consists of lowercase English letters only.
